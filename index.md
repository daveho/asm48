Info
====

Asm48 is a cross assembler for the ubiquitous Intel(tm) 8048 family of
microcontrollers.  The assembler is at an early stage of development. 
However, the major functionality is in place, and with some testing it
will be considered stable very soon.  If you feel slightly adventurous
and don\'t mind fixing some bugs, you could probably use Asm48 right
now.

Download
========

Official releases can be downloaded from the [files
area](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=72293).

CVS Access
==========

You can check out the latest version of the source code using CVS from
the [SourceForge project page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/asm48/). 
Click on the \"CVS Repository\" link at the bottom of the page, and
follow the directions for Anonymous CVS Access.  Use \"asm48\" as
*modulename*.

You can also [browse the CVS
repository](http://asm48.cvs.sourceforge.net/asm48).

The latest source is also available in the multi-platform ZIP package
for version 0.4.1 that you\'ll find in the [files
area](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=72293).

Compiling and Installing
========================

Asm48 is written in standard C, and uses
[flex](http://www.gnu.org/software/flex) and
[bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison).  You also will need [GNU
Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make) (although the Makefile could
easily be modified for other make variants).  Most Unix-like systems
(such as Linux and FreeBSD) and Windows machines running
[Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/) should be able to build Asm48. See the
[README](http://sourceforge.net/projects/asm48/files/asm48/asm48-0.4.1/README/download)
for more information on how to build.
