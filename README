===========
What is it?
===========

Asm48 is an assembler for the Intel 8048 family of microcontrollers.
It is free software; you may use, modify, and redistribute it according to
the terms specified in the various source files.

In case you don't know, the Intel 8048 family was one of the very
first commercially successful microcontroller product lines.  You can
find them in an enormous range of devices, such as cars, computer
keyboards, industrial equipment, etc.  Members of the 8048 family include
the 8021, 8035, 8038, 8039, 8040, 8048, 8049, 8050, 8748, and 8749.
(I believe the 8041 and 8042 are also in the same general family,
although I think the instruction encodings are somewhat different, and
thus I wouldn't necessarily expect this assembler to support those chips.)

You can find the 8048 in the Magnavox Odyssey^2 game system and certain
arcade video games.

Acknowledgements

This product includes software developed by the University of
California, Berkeley and its contributors.

The file "ihex.c" was written by Paul Stoffregen.

The file "8039dasm.c" was written by Michael Cuddy,
and was shamelessly stolen from the MAME/MESS project.

============
Installation
============

Just run the command "make".  There are a couple configurable options in
the Makefile you might want to change.  I assume you have flex and bison
available on your system.  You should be able to use other lex and yacc
variants, although you might need to change the Makefile a bit.

The resulting executables are called "asm48" and "8039dasm".  They are the
assembler and disassembler, respectively.

===========
Usage notes
===========

To a large extent, I've tried to follow the assembly syntax described in
the Intel 8048 user manual.  However, I've made some gratuitous changes:

  - Lower case is accepted for instruction mnemonics, register names, etc.
  - EQU directives are written differently
  - The '#' prefix indicating an immediate value may be specified or
    omitted at your whim
  - Hex constants may be specified using the standard C notation
    (0x1A) rather than the Intel notation (1Ah)

Three kinds of directives are allowed:

  .equ IDENTIFIER, VALUE
  .org VALUE
  .db VALUE

The special symbol ".here" may be used to refer to the address of the
current instruction.

Values may be expressions using the standard arithmetic operators
("+", "-", "*", "/"), as well as left and right shifts ("<<" and ">>"),
bitwise "&" (and) and "|" (or), and bitwise complement (the unary "~" operator).
All expressions are evaluated using host platform ints.  Operator precedence
follows the equivalent C operators.

Disclaimers and contact info
============================

If you actually use this assembler, please send me an email at
<daveho@cs.umd.edu>.  I wrote it on a lark[*], and given how crufty
and ancient the 8048 is, I'd be surprised and amused to find out that
someone else was interested in writing code for it.  I will also
happily accept bug fixes and new features.

There are almost certainly bugs in this software, so use at your own risk.
I accept absolutely no responsibility for any consequences resulting
from the use of this software.

If you do decide to use the assembler, you are STRONGLY ADVISED to run
your assembled code through the included disassembler to check that the
assembler output looks reasonable.

Have fun!
